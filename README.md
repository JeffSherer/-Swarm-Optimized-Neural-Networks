# -Swarm-Optimized-Neural-Networks
A biologically inspired computation approach for optimizing neural networks using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). A banknote fraud dataset is used to evaluate classification accuracy. Swarm intelligence fine-tunes network weights, incorporating adaptive learning, informant strategies, early stopping, and performance evaluation with confusion matrices and ROC curves.
